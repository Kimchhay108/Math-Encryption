🔐 Caesar Cipher & RSA Web Calculator
This is a web-based tool built by Team 4 that helps users encrypt and decrypt messages using Caesar Cipher and RSA encryption. The main goal is to give a simple and visual way to learn how these classic cryptographic techniques work.

📌 Features
✅ Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

✅ RSA Key Generation

✅ RSA Encryption & Decryption

✅ Clean web interface

✅ Real-time result updates

🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?
Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

Example:
Plaintext: HELLO
Key (Shift): 3
Ciphertext: KHOOR

🔐 What is RSA?
RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that uses two keys – a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt. It is widely used for secure data transmission.

Main concepts:

Large prime numbers

Modular arithmetic

Public and private key pairs
